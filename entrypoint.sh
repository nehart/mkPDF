# GitLab "CICD"
# %%%%%%%%%%%%%
#
# It is necessary to consider certain factors before using CICD.
#
# When a CICD job runs in a Docker container ...
#
#   *) The runner starts the Docker container using the defined entrypoint. 
#   *) the runner mounts a "/builds" directory, which contains the repository's content.
#   *) The runner attaches itself to a running container.
#   *) The runner prepares a script (the combination of "before_script", "script", and "after_script").
#   *) The runner executes the "before_script", "script", and "after_script" commands in the "/builds/<project-path>/" directory.
#
# By default, the Docker executor does not override the ENTRYPOINT script. The runner expects that the image has no ENTRYPOINT or
# that the ENTRYPOINT is prepared to start a shell by passing "sh" or "bash" as the CMD.
#
# In the event that the Docker image in question lacks the requisite support for this mechanism, it is possible to override the image’s
# ENTRYPOINT within the project configuration (the ".gitlab-ci.yml" file). This can be achieved as follows:
#
#   # [...]
#   #
#   # image:
#   #   name: mariadb:experimental
#   #   entrypoint: [""]
#   #
#   # [...]
